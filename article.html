			<p class="text">In 1991, id Software released Commander Keen 4: Secret of the Oracle. In the game resides one of the most iconic recurring faces of classic PC gaming - the Dopefish.
				Known as the second dumbest creature in the universe, its thought pattern goes like this:<p>
<!--			<br>-->
			<p class="text">"swim swim hungry, swim swim hungry"</p>
<!--			<br>-->
			<p class="text">If you meet one in real life, stay back! They'll eat anything that lives and moves, and if you're a hero, good luck - that's its favorite meal.
				Though, running into one of these dihydrogen monoxide creatures is a lot more likely than you think; when Duke Nukem 3D released its shareware, people found a message indicating a planned appearance in Level 5. The message read, "DOPEFISH LIVES."</p>
			<p class="text">id Software would once again implement the Dopefish in 1996's Quake, but not as a hungry hero muncher. In Episode 2 Level 3, the player could find a passage that led to the Well of Wishes. It's not an exact replica of Dopefish's home in Keen 4, but the game does welcome the wanderer into it. Search deep enough, and a picture of the smiling Dope can be found with the message "THE DOPEFISH LIVES!"</p>
			<p class="text">There are more instances of Dopefish outside of its native residence - a scrapped level in ROTT, Quake II, Jazz Jackrabbit 2, Daikatana, and so forth. You'd be amazed to see how sneaky, yet prevalent the Dopefish is in popular gaming culture. With that said, see if you can find every Dopefish in the universe!</p>
